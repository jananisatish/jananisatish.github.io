# MusicToColor - Synesthesia Piano

According to Merriam-Webster, synesthesia is "a subjective sensation or image of a sense (as of color) other than the one (as of sound) being stimulated". In other words,
a synesthete (someone with synesthesia) will have multiple senses triggered by something that would only trigger one sense for others. One example is letters or numbers 
triggering different colors (this is called grapheme-color synesthesia). The MusicToColor Synesthesia Piano focuses on one specific branch of this condition:
chromesthesia.

Chromesthesia, also known as colored hearing, is exactly what it sounds like: different notes or songs trigger different colors for the chromesthete. As someone with this
condition, I created the MusicToColor Synesthesia Piano to visualize chromesthesia as best as I could. It can be used simply as a fun sensory app, or it can help others
figure out if they have chromesthesia. 

There are 24 keys, or 2 octaves, on the MusicToColor Synesthesia Piano. Each key in one octave (which consists of 12 keys) has its own associated color that will be
visualized on-screen when you press it. There are three types of visuals to choose from: blobs, clouds, and waves. The default is blobs, which is shown below, and it has
a little surprise for desktop users if you click on the ! in the corner.

You can use the buttons in the top right corner to record and play back your own tunes. Once you have recorded your tune, you will be given a link that will have your
stored tune on it. Here is an example of a tune I made: https://musictocolor.com?t=Blobs&v=Dt4VGhmiDhoRUgoaAfoS6g6W

I hope to release an updated version soon that allows you to customize the colors for each key, as chromesthetes usually don't see the same colors for each note. But for
now, have fun playing!
